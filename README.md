# Cybersecurity-and-Network
In this portfolio, I am going to be documenting my projects. Currently,
I am forging my knowledge for 2 industry certs; Sec+ and CCNA

Project 1
In this lab, I deployed a three-tier virtual network consisting of a Kali Linux attacker, 
an Ubuntu web server, and a Windows 10 client. I performed a network discovery scan using Nmap to 
identify exposed services. Upon finding an open HTTP port (80) on the Ubuntu server, I performed 
host hardening by configuring the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) 
to block unauthorized traffic, successfully reducing the server's attack surface.
